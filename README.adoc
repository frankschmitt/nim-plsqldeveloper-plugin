= PREREQUISITES
You'll need the Nim compiler and Mingw. Just hop to http://nim-lang.org, download the latest compiler version, unzip it, and run finish.exe - this will take care of the rest (adapt your %PATH% and install the MingW compiler).

= INSTALL
```nimble install winim```

= RUN
```nim c --run main.nim```
